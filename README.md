Saint Paul ACM Club Autonomous Robot


This project is an ongoing effort to create and run a autonomous robot capable of sensing and reacting to its environment.
The current model uses a Raspberry Pi in conjunction with a RaspiRobotBoard (see below) and HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors to control a small, inexpensive, toy car.

Initial hardware, software, and ideas to get started are thanks in part to:

RaspiRobotBoard available through www.sparkfun.com
- Motor board and python library https://github.com/simonmonk/raspirobotboard/wiki

Matt Hawkins at www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk
- Initial sonic sensor python script found at: http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/archive/python/ultrasonic_2.py

HC-SR04 distance sensors used came from www.sanesmart.com
